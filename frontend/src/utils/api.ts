This combination demonstrated an objective response rate of 26.8%. The addition of binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) to this combination showed marginal additional benefit in the BEACON CRC trial.

    {
      question: "What is the mechanism of action for encorafenib in treating BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer?",

    },
    {
      question: "Why is cetuximab combined with BRAF inhibitors in treatment regimens?",
      answer: "Cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor, is combined with BRAF inhibitors to prevent feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway through EGFR signaling, which occurs when BRAF is inhibited alone in colorectal cancer."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the presence of KRAS mutations affect BRAF-targeted therapy?",
