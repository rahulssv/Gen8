Although ER-targeted therapies are available, 30% of \npatients will develop resistance, underscoring the need for new \nnon-ER/estrogen-based treatments. Notably, HR+BCs exhibit poor lymphocyte \ninfiltration and contain an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which \ncontributes to the limited efficacy of immunotherapies in HR+BC. In this study, \nwe demonstrate that PR/progesterone signaling reduces major histocompatibility \ncomplex (MHC) Class I expression, facilitating immune evasion and escape from \nimmune-based clearance of PR+tumors.\nMETHODS: To determine the effect of PR/progesterone on MHC Class I expression, \nwe treated human and mouse mammary tumor cell lines with progesterone and/or \ninterferon (IFN) and measured expression of genes involved in antigen processing \nand presentation (APP), as well as surface MHC Class I expression. We used the \nOT-I/SIINFEKL model antigen system to measure the impact of progesterone on \nimmune cell-mediated killing of modified tumor cells. We also analyzed two large \nBC clinical cohorts to determine how PR expression correlates with APP gene \nexpression and MHC Class I expression in ER-positive tumors.\nRESULTS: In vitro, we show that PR/progesterone signaling reduces APP gene \nexpression and MHC class I expression in human and breast mammary tumor cell \nlines. PR-mediated attenuation of APP/MHC Class I expression is more pronounced \nin the presence of IFN. In immune cell killing assays, PR-expressing mammary \ntumor cells treated with progesterone are protected from immune-mediated \ncytotoxicity. We demonstrate that PR expression in vivo prevents immune-mediated \nrejection of xenoantigen-modified mammary tumor cell lines through mechanisms \ninvolving MHC Class I expression and CD8 T cells. Data analysis of two large BC \ncohorts reveals lower APP gene expression and MHC Class I expression in \nER/PR-positive tumors compared with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors. These \nfindings show that HR+BCs, specifically PR+tumors, downregulate APP/MHC class I \nmachinery through PR/progesterone signaling. Use of pharmacological \nPR/progesterone inhibitors may reverse these effects in patients with BC, \nthereby improving immunosurveillance and response to immunotherapies.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

However, the \neffects of cyclin E1 overexpression on tumor immunity and its effects on the \nresponse to immune checkpoint inhibitors remain largely unclear.\nMETHODS: Tissue microarrays and clinical outcomes of 398 patients with breast \ncancer were analyzed to explore the correlation between cyclin E1 expression, \npatient survival, and immune cell infiltration using immunohistochemistry. \nGenomic data from publicly available data sets and three clinical trials \nevaluating immunotherapy were assessed to measure the impact of cyclin E1 \nexpression on the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and response to \nimmunotherapy in patients with breast cancer. In addition, breast cancer cell \nlines with inducible cyclin E1 overexpression were employed to analyze the \neffects of cyclin E1 on inflammatory signaling.\nRESULTS: Increased cyclin E1 expression in breast cancer was positively \ncorrelated with immune cell infiltration, including T cells, B cells, and \nnatural killer cells, and activation of interferon-related pathways. \nImportantly, higher cyclin E1 expression or CCNE1 amplification was associated \nwith better response to immunotherapy in three clinical trials. Mechanistically, \ncyclin E1 overexpression resulted in micronuclei formation and activation of \ninnate immune signaling, resulting in increased immune cell migration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show that cyclin E1 overexpression associate with \nantitumor immunity through activation of innate inflammatory signaling and \nwarrants investigation into amplification or overexpression of cyclin E1 in \nidentifying patients with breast cancer eligible for immunotherapy.\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Despite advancements in treatment, brain metastasis \nincidence is rising, with a poor prognosis. Moreover, limited data exist on how \nbreast cancer subtypes and patient characteristics impact survival. This study \naimed to investigate prognostic factors affecting breast cancer patients with \nbrain metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed 131 breast cancer patients with \nbrain metastasis diagnosed at a single institution between 2010 and 2020. \nDemographic, clinical, pathological, and radiographic variables were analyzed. \nThe median interval between breast cancer diagnosis and brain metastasis was 27 \nmonths. Patients diagnosed with a higher stage of breast cancer (median \nsurvival: stage 1: 97.2 months, stage 2: 44.4 months, stage 3: 38.1 months, \nstage 4: 13.0 months, P\u2005<\u2005.001) and those with ER-negative tumors (median \nsurvival: negative 25.3 months, positive 37.5 months, P\u2005=\u2005.034) had a shorter \ntime between initial diagnosis and brain metastasis. Median survival after brain \nmetastasis was 8.0 months. Multivariate analysis showed that triple-negative \nbreast cancer was correlated to a high risk of death after brain metastasis \n(hazard ratio\u2005=\u20052.320, P\u2005<\u2005.001). Higher histological grade, low-performance \nstatus, extensive brain metastases, and leptomeningeal seeding was associated \nwith shorter survival. Systemic chemotherapy after brain metastasis was the only \ntreatment that improved survival (hazard ratio\u2005=\u20050.332, P\u2005<\u2005.001). The study \nsuggests potential benefits of aggressive treatment, especially in \nnontriple-negative breast cancer subtypes, limited brain metastases, and good \noverall health.

Additionally, accurately assessing axillary lymph node \nmetastasis (ALNM) plays a significant role in clinical management and prognosis \nfor breast cancer patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a commonly used \nimaging modality in physical and preoperative evaluations. This study aims to \ndevelop a deep learning model based on chest CT imaging to improve the \npreliminary assessment of breast lesions, potentially reducing the need for \ncostly follow-up procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron \nemission tomography-CT and alleviating the financial and emotional burden on \npatients. We retrospectively collected chest CT images from 482 patients with \nbreast masses, classifying them as benign (n = 224) or malignant (n = 258) based \non pathological findings. The malignant group was further categorized into \nALNM-positive (n = 91) and ALNM-negative (n = 167) subgroups. Patients were \nrandomly divided into training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio, \nwith the test set excluded from model development. All patients underwent \nnon-contrast chest CT before surgery. After preprocessing the images through \ncropping, scaling, and standardization, we applied ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and \nResNet-101 architectures to differentiate between benign and malignant masses \nand to assess ALNM. Model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, \nspecificity, accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the \narea under the curve (AUC). The ResNet models effectively distinguished benign \nfrom malignant masses, with ResNet-101 achieving the highest performance (AUC: \n0.964; 95% CI: 0.948-0.981). It also demonstrated excellent predictive \ncapability for ALNM (AUC: 0.951; 95% CI: 0.926-0.975). In conclusion, these deep \nlearning models show strong diagnostic potential for both breast mass \nclassification and ALNM prediction, offering a valuable tool for improving \nclinical decision-making.\n\nDOI: 10.17305/bb.2025.12010\nPMID: 40100034",

It acts as a microRNA \nsponge, disrupting transcription and the abnormal expression of oncogenes. \nHsa_circ_0024715, a circRNA generated from cyclization at specific sites of the \nHSPA8 gene, has been found to be highly expressed in breast cancer (BC) tissue \nbased on non-coding RNA high-throughput sequencing. However, its functions \nremain poorly understood. In this study, we performed qPCR to evaluate the \nexpression of circHSPA8 in BC tissues. Survival analysis in a prospective cohort \nrevealed that high expression of circHSPA8 is associated with poor prognosis and \nlymphoid node metastasis. Overexpression of circHSPA8 in MCF-7 cells \nsignificantly enhanced their proliferative and invasive abilities, whereas \nknockdown of circHSPA8 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced their \nproliferative and invasive abilities. We found that circHSPA8 can promote \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells, primarily by upregulating \nthe expression of WNT3A. This process depends on the sponging and inhibition of \nmiR-195-5p, which suppresses the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of BC \ncells. In\u00a0vivo experiments further confirmed that circHSPA8 can promote the \nintravasation and extravasation of BC cells as well as the formation of \nmetastatic lesions in the lungs. In summary, these data demonstrate that \ncircHSPA8 promotes EMT by acting as a competitive inhibitor of miR-195-5p to \nupregulate the expression of WNT3A in BC, suggesting that dysregulation of \ncircRNA in BC might be a pathological factor and potential therapeutic target.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).
