# Detailed Solution for Curation Challenges in Extracting Information from Research Articles
The curation teams are facing significant challenges when extracting and interpreting information from research articles, particularly related to biomarkers, mutations, and their associations with biomedical entities like clinical trials, drugs, diseases, and other complications. Below, I outline the current issues faced by curators, followed by a proposed solution to address these challenges efficiently using publicly available databases such as PubMed, Taylor & Francis, and others, with a focus on PubMed.

### Challenges Faced by Curation Teams

1. **Time-Intensive Process**:
    - Reading and interpreting a single research article takes approximately **4-5 hours**, including making notes and understanding clinical implications.
    - Cross-referencing information with other databases or articles adds further delays, often extending the process to **1-2 days per article**.
    - For a query requiring insights from multiple articles (e.g., 5-10 articles), this becomes impractical, taking days or weeks to complete.
2. **Complexity of Information**:
    - Curators need to extract specific details about **biomarkers and mutations** (e.g., BRAF V600E mutation in colorectal cancer) and their associations with:
        - **Drugs** (e.g., best treatments available).
        - **Clinical trials** (e.g., outcomes, efficacy).
        - **Diseases** (e.g., colorectal cancer).
        - **Coexisting biomarkers/mutations** (e.g., BRAF V600E with KRAS mutation) and their combined effects on patients.
        - **Statistical data** (e.g., efficacy rates, survival rates, performance metrics).
    - Articles contain dense, technical information that requires expertise to interpret correctly.
3. **Volume of Articles**:
    - A single query (e.g., "co-medication in cardiovascular system") can yield thousands of results (e.g., 15,663 articles in PubMed), making it impossible to read each one manually.
    - Curators need a way to filter and focus on the **most relevant 5-10 articles** for their specific study or question.
4. **Flexibility Requirements**:
    - Curators work on diverse areas (e.g., colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer), and their queries vary widely.
    - The solution must not be limited to a specific mutation or disease but should be adaptable to **any mutation-related query** and associated entities (drugs, trials, diseases, etc.).
5. **Evidence-Based Insights**:
    - Treatments today are **evidence-based**, requiring curators to provide statistical data (e.g., "this treatment offers a 75% survival rate") and link it to published research.
    - Current methods lack the ability to quickly summarize and present this data with references.
6. **Lack of Customization**:
    - Existing tools (e.g., ScienceDirect’s recent summarization features) provide general summaries but do not allow users to:
        - Select specific articles.
        - Customize summaries based on a query (e.g., "best treatment for BRAF V600E mutation").
        - Include references or links to PDFs for verification.

### Proposed Solution: A Web-Based Curation Platform

To address these challenges, I propose a **web-based platform** designed to streamline the curation process by extracting and summarizing relevant information from research articles in databases like PubMed, Taylor & Francis, and others. The platform will reduce the time spent per query from hours or days to **20-30 minutes**, while providing accurate, query-specific, and evidence-based insights with references.

### Key Features

1. **Query Input and Search**:
    - Users can input specific queries, e.g., "What is the best treatment for BRAF V600E mutation in colorectal cancer?" or "Effect of BRAF V600E coexisting with KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer."
    - The system searches databases (primarily PubMed, with support for Taylor & Francis) using their APIs to retrieve a list of relevant articles.
2. **Article Selection**:
    - Articles are ranked by relevance, and users can review titles, abstracts, or metadata to select a subset (e.g., 5-10 articles) most pertinent to their query.
    - This ensures curators focus only on the most relevant sources, avoiding the need to sift through thousands of results.
3. **Information Extraction**:
    - The system uses advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract key information from selected articles:
        - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies biomarkers (e.g., BRAF), mutations (e.g., V600E), drugs, diseases, and clinical trials.
        - **Relation Extraction**: Determines associations (e.g., "encorafenib treats BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer").
        - **Statistical Data Extraction**: Parses numerical data (e.g., survival rates, efficacy percentages) from text or tables.
        - **Coexisting Entities**: Detects mentions of coexisting biomarkers/mutations and their combined effects (e.g., reduced efficacy when BRAF V600E and KRAS coexist).
4. **Summarization**:
    - The extracted information is summarized into a concise, query-specific report.
    - Example output: "The combination of encorafenib and cetuximab shows a median overall survival of 15 months in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer, compared to 10 months with standard therapy."
    - Summaries include statistical data and are tailored to the user’s question, avoiding generic overviews.
5. **Report Generation**:
    - The report includes:
        - A summary of key findings.
        - **Citations** to the original articles with links to PDFs or full-text sources (where available).
        - Excerpts of original text for verification.
    - Users can refine their query or article selection if the initial report needs adjustment.
6. **Flexibility and Customization**:
    - The platform supports queries across **any mutation, disease, or biomedical entity**, making it suitable for curators with expertise in various areas (e.g., colon cancer, lung cancer).
    - Users can specify multiple entities (e.g., coexisting mutations) or focus on specific aspects (e.g., statistical efficacy).
7. **Efficiency**:
    - Articles are pre-processed, and extracted data (entities, relations, statistics) is stored in a database for quick retrieval.
    - This ensures the system processes queries rapidly, delivering results in **20-30 minutes**.
8. **User Interface**:
    - A **web-based platform** allows users to:
        - Input queries.
        - Select articles from a ranked list.
        - View and download reports.
        - Save queries and reports for future reference or team sharing.

### Technical Implementation

- **Search**:
    - Use PubMed API and Taylor & Francis API to fetch article metadata, abstracts, and full text (where available).
    - Rank articles based on relevance to the query.
- **Information Extraction**:
    - Employ pre-trained biomedical NLP models (e.g., SciBERT, PubMedBERT) for NER and relation extraction.
    - Use custom modules to extract statistical data from text or tables (e.g., Tabula for PDF tables).
- **Summarization**:
    - Combine **extractive summarization** (selecting key sentences) and **abstractive summarization** (paraphrasing) using language models fine-tuned on biomedical text.
    - Ensure summaries are faithful to the source by linking to original excerpts.
- **PDF Handling**:
    - Extract text from PDFs using libraries like PyMuPDF, prioritizing HTML/text formats when available.
    - Provide warnings if data from PDF-only articles is incomplete.
- **Database Integration**:
    - Pre-process articles and store extracted data in a scalable database (e.g., cloud-based).
    - Optionally integrate with [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) or DrugBank for additional context (e.g., trial details, drug side effects).
- **Standardization**:
    - Normalize entities using ontologies (e.g., HGNC for genes, HPO for phenotypes) to ensure consistency across articles.

### Example Workflow

1. **Query**: "What is the best treatment for BRAF V600E mutation in colorectal cancer?"
2. **Search**: The system retrieves articles from PubMed and Taylor & Francis.
3. **Selection**: The user selects 10 relevant articles.
4. **Extraction**: The system identifies treatments (e.g., encorafenib + cetuximab), statistical data (e.g., 15-month survival), and coexisting mutation effects.
5. **Report**: Output: "Based on selected articles, encorafenib and cetuximab offer a median survival of 15 months for BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer, with efficacy reduced when KRAS mutations coexist [Ref 1, Ref 2]."
6. **Delivery**: The report includes citations and links to PDFs.
